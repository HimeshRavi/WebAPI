    <p>An overview of the main project folders and files:</p>
    <div>
        <h3><u>Pages folder</u></h3>
        Contains Razor pages and supporting files. Each Razor page is a pair of files:
        <ul>
            <li>
                A <i>.cshtml</i> file that contains HTML markup with C# code using Razor syntax.
            </li>
            <li>
                A <i>.cshtml.cs</i> file that contains C# code that handles page events.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Supporting files have names that begin with an underscore.<br />
        For example, the <i>_Layout.cshtml</i> file configures UI elements common to all pages.<br />
        This file sets up the navigation menu at the top of the page and the copyright notice at the bottom of the page.
